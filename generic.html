								This prototype was created in my "User Center Design" course at KSU.
								I had a partner who played the role as a client in which I had to build a high fidelity prototype
								for the application they wanted built. This prototype is functional to an extent and you can find
								at this link (https://marvelapp.com/prototype/4behgad).

							<span class="images"><img src="images/PaperPrototype.png" alt="Paper Prototype" /></span>
							<p>
								This paper prototype was created for the first deliverable for my "Software Project Management" class.
								The course was essentially a semester long project and the main role I played on my team was to be in charge of the GUI
								and wireframes. Becuase this paper prototype was only for the first deliverable it only serves about half
								of what the final project came to be.

				<h2>UML Examples</h2>
				<span class="images"><img src="images/PetSittingActivityDiagram.png" alt="Pet Sitting Activity Diagram" /></span>
				<p>
					While given the task to create a mobile application for a client who was in need of a pet sitting app,
					I took oppertunity to create an activity diagram for so. 
		

				<span class="images"><img src="images/SpmActivityDiagram.png" alt="SPM Activity Diagram" /></span>
					An activity diagram created in my "Software Project Management" course. This diagram shows the steps of how the app is going to
					function. This of course was done before I created the wireframes for this project and it made the job of completing the task a lot easier. 

				

				<span class="images"><img src="images/PizzaScopeDiagram.png" alt="Pizza Scope Diagram" /></span>
				<p>
					A scope diagram designated for a pizza delivery system created in my "Intro to Software Engineering" course.

								<span class="images"><img src="images/TestPlanDiagram.png" alt="Test Plan Diagram" /></span>
				<p>
					A test plan diagram I created for a project where I practiced software quality assurance skills.
